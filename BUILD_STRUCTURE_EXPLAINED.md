# Build Structure Explanation

## Your Current Build Output

The build command creates a production-ready structure:

```
dist/
├── index.js          # Compiled backend server (esbuild)
└── public/           # Frontend static files (Vite)
    ├── assets/       # JS/CSS bundles
    └── index.html    # Main HTML file
```

## Why This Structure?

**Frontend (`dist/public/`)**:
- Built by Vite from the `client/` directory
- Creates optimized static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Assets are bundled and minified for production

**Backend (`dist/index.js`)**:
- Built by esbuild from `server/index.ts`
- Creates a single compiled Node.js file
- Includes all dependencies bundled together

## How It Works in Production

1. **PM2 runs**: `dist/index.js` (the compiled backend)
2. **Backend serves**: Static files from `dist/public/`
3. **Backend handles**: API routes at `/api/v1/*`
4. **Frontend**: Served from `dist/public/index.html`

This is the standard production setup for full-stack applications.

## Updated Deployment

The deployment scripts now correctly:
- Build both frontend and backend
- Use `dist/index.js` for PM2 (not TypeScript source)
- Serve static files from `dist/public/`
- Remove TSX interpreter dependency in production

Run the complete fix script to deploy with the correct build structure.
