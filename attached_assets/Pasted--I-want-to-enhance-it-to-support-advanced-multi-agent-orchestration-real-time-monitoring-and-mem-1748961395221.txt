). I want to enhance it to support advanced multi-agent orchestration, real-time monitoring, and memory. Please help me implement the following features across backend and frontend, without writing code, just outline and scaffold the feature logic and structure:

⸻

🔁 1. Agent Memory Module with Vector DB (pgvector)

Enable each agent to store and retrieve embeddings from a vector database for long-term memory. This memory should include inputs, outputs, feedback, and session IDs. Memory should be queryable via semantic similarity and evolve with feedback.

⸻

🧠 2. Custom Agent Response Schema

Allow each agent to have a modifiable response type using JSON Schema. This schema should be validated post-execution and used to ensure consistent downstream integration.

⸻

📡 3. Live Agent Execution Logs

Enable real-time streaming of logs during agent execution via WebSocket, and persist logs in a database. Logs should be viewable by session, agent ID, and step type with filtering options.

⸻

🔌 4. MCP Connector Builder (Low-code UI)

Add a UI flow to let users create and register new API/database connectors via a form. Users should define name, type, authentication, endpoints, and sample request/response bodies. These should become usable modules for agents.

⸻

🔄 5. Agent Communication and Chaining

Support agent-to-agent messaging and chaining workflows. Allow users to define input/output mappings, sequence order, conditions (IF, SWITCH), and retry policies. Chains should support monitoring, validation, and modular configuration.

⸻

🧱 6. Agent Modules (Plug-and-play)

Standardize modules like prompt, logging, recommendation, document generation, code generation, database access, etc. Each module should be attachable to agents via UI and stored in agent configuration.

⸻

🚀 7. Agent App Builder (New Tab in UI)

Add a new tab where users can create a complete “Agent App” by combining:
	•	Multiple agents
	•	Connectors (e.g., APIs, DBs, events, MCPs)
	•	Independent modules (memory, prompt, logging)
	•	Logic gates & guardrails
	•	Custom output schemas

Users should be able to configure agent flow visually or via structured forms and set input/output mappings between nodes. Each Agent App should be executable, show live logs, and return a unified response schema.

⸻

🌐 8. Geo-personalized Agent App Use Case

As a test app, build a geospatial-aware agent app that recommends hotels, flights, cars, and events based on:
	•	Age range, cardholder status, CRM user data
	•	Historical booking data, current search trends
	•	Geolocation, spending capacity
	•	Seasonal events/festivals in a given time range
This app should combine hotel, car, marketing, and event agents, and respond with a list of top recommendations using vector search and API connectors.
