- Optimized indexes for authentication queries

### üîß Configuration Updates

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Server Configuration (Updated)
PORT=5000                    # Changed from 5005
HOST=0.0.0.0                # Proper binding for all interfaces

# Authentication (New)
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# Database (Required)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

#### Development Workflow
